            When visitors leave comments on our site we collect the data shown

         If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, 
         email address, and website in cookies. These are for your convenience 
         so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave 
         another comment. These cookies will last for one year. 
         If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to 
         determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no 
         personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.<br>

         When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your 
         login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last 
         for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you 
         select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. When you 
         log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.<br>

         If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved 
         in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply 
         indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires 
         after 1 day.

            Who do we share your data with and how long do we retain it If you 
            leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained 
            indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any 
            follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a 
            moderation queue.<br>

            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the 
            personal information they provide in their user profile. 
            All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at 
            any time (except they cannot change their username). 
            Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
